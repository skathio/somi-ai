## Conventions in these docs

- **"SoMi AI"** — the product; **"SoMi"** — the short form used in prose.
- **"agent"** = a specialised subagent under `agents/` invoked via the Task tool.
- **"command"** = a `/slash-command` under `commands/`.
- **"skill"** = an on-demand expert pack under `skills/`.
- **"hook"** = a deterministic guardrail script under `hooks/`.
- **"rule"** = a paragraph or section in `rules/` that the model follows.
- **"workflow"** = one of {planning, coding, reviewing} — the three first-class user-facing flows.
- **"artifact"** = a durable file produced by a workflow, stored under `.somi/plans/<slug>/` (`spec.md`, `decisions.md`, `progress.md`, phase files, reviews, etc.).
- **"work item"** = one `/plan` invocation's worth of artifacts, living in its own `.somi/plans/<slug>/` directory.
