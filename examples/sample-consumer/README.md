# sample-consumer — minimal project consuming somi-ai

This directory shows what a project looks like **after** installing SoMi AI via the Claude Code
plugin marketplace:

```text
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/skathio/somi-ai
/plugin install somi-ai@somi-ai
```

It's a layout reference, not a runnable project — there's no application code here, just the
files SoMi AI's plugin runtime places.

## What you should see in your own project after install

## Things to notice

- **`CLAUDE.md` is at the project root**, not under `.claude/`. Claude Code automatically loads it
  as project-level instructions.
- **Hooks live under `.claude/plugins/somi-ai/hooks/`** and are referenced via `${SOMI_ROOT}` in
  `settings.json` so they work regardless of where the plugin root resolves.
- **`settings.json` is the merge of your existing settings + SoMi AI hooks/permissions**. Your
  existing `permissions.allow` is preserved; SoMi AI hook entries are appended; SoMi AI deny rules are
  added (union-merge).

## What stays yours after install

- `CLAUDE.md` — the plugin runtime does not overwrite a hand-edited `CLAUDE.md`. Add
  project-specific instructions in [`rules/99-overrides.md`](../../rules/99-overrides.md)
  (which SoMi AI never touches) or directly in your `CLAUDE.md`.
- All your existing `settings.json` keys outside of `hooks`, `permissions`, and `env`.
- Everything under `.somi/` — workflow artifacts, not SoMi AI internals. Work items persist
  indefinitely; only you delete from there.

## Updating

```text
/plugin update somi-ai
```

## Uninstalling

```text
/plugin uninstall somi-ai
```

Removes the plugin. Leaves your `CLAUDE.md`, `.somi/` artifacts, and `audit.log` alone.
